# This file configures the analyzer, which statically analyzes Dart code to
# check for errors, warnings, and lints.
#
# The issues identified by the analyzer are surfaced in the UI of Dart-enabled
# IDEs (https://dart.dev/tools#ides-and-editors). The analyzer can also be
# invoked from the command line by running `flutter analyze`.

# The following line activates a set of recommended lints for Flutter apps,
# packages, and plugins designed to encourage good coding practices.
include: package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml

analyzer:
  language:
    strict-raw-types: true
    strict-casts: true

linter:
  # The lint rules applied to this project can be customized in the
  # section below to disable rules from the `package:flutter_lints/flutter.yaml`
  # included above or to enable additional rules. A list of all available lints
  # and their documentation is published at https://dart.dev/lints.
  #
  # Instead of disabling a lint rule for the entire project in the
  # section below, it can also be suppressed for a single line of code
  # or a specific dart file by using the `// ignore: name_of_lint` and
  # `// ignore_for_file: name_of_lint` syntax on the line or in the file
  # producing the lint.
  rules:
    # avoid_print: false  # Uncomment to disable the `avoid_print` rule
    prefer_single_quotes: true  # Uncomment to enable the `prefer_single_quotes` rule

    avoid_escaping_inner_quotes: true # Avoid escaping inner quotes by converting surrounding quotes.
    eol_at_end_of_file: true  # Put a single newline at end of file.]

    prefer_foreach: true  # Use forEach to only apply a function to all the elements.
    prefer_int_literals: true # Prefer int literals over double literals.
    require_trailing_commas: true # Use trailing commas for all parameter lists and argument lists.
    sized_box_shrink_expand: true # Use SizedBox shrink and expand named constructors.
    unnecessary_await_in_return: true # Unnecessary await keyword in return.
    unnecessary_breaks: true  # Don't use explicit breaks when a break is implied.
    unnecessary_lambdas: true # Don't create a lambda when a tear-off will do.
    unnecessary_parenthesis: true # Unnecessary parentheses can be removed.
    unnecessary_raw_strings: true # Unnecessary raw string.
    use_colored_box: true # Use ColoredBox.

    use_named_constants: true # Use predefined named constants.
    use_raw_strings: true # Use raw string to avoid escapes.
    use_string_buffers: true  # Use string buffers to compose strings.
    use_test_throws_matchers: true  # Use throwsA matcher instead of fail().
    use_to_and_as_if_applicable: true # Start the name of the method with to/_to or as/_as if applicable.
